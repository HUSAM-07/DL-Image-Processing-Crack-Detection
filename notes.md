# Differences between the `deep-learning` folder and `tensorflow-model.py`


1. Deep Learning Frameworks:

First Code (PyTorch): Utilizes PyTorch, a dynamic computational graph framework known for its flexibility and ease of use in research settings.

Second Code (TensorFlow): Employs TensorFlow, a framework that uses static computation graphs, often preferred for large-scale deployments.

2. Model Architecture:

First Code (PyTorch): Implements a U-Net style architecture, commonly used for image segmentation tasks. This architecture includes:

Encoder: Sequential convolutional layers that downsample the input image, capturing contextual information.

Decoder: Up-convolutional layers that upsample the feature maps, aiming to reconstruct the output image with the same dimensions as the input.

Skip Connections: Directly connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder, preserving spatial information.

Second Code (TensorFlow): Constructs a fully connected neural network:

Input Layer: Accepts a flattened image vector concatenated with two additional features extracted via edge detection and Hough transform.

Hidden Layers: Comprise dense layers with batch normalization and dropout for regularization.

Output Layer: Produces a flattened vector reshaped into the desired image dimensions.

3. Data Preprocessing:

First Code (PyTorch): Loads image pairs (initial and final frames) from a specified directory, applies transformations like resizing and normalization, and prepares them for training.

Second Code (TensorFlow): Loads grayscale images, extracts features using edge detection and Hough transform to identify lines, and combines these features with the flattened image data for model input.

4. Training Process:

First Code (PyTorch): Defines a mean squared error loss function and uses the Adam optimizer. The model is trained over a specified number of epochs, and the trained model is saved to a file.

Second Code (TensorFlow): Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, compiles the model with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and trains the model over a defined number of epochs. The trained model is then saved.

5. Dependency Management:

First Code (PyTorch): Assumes that necessary packages are installed and does not include explicit dependency checks.

Second Code (TensorFlow): Includes a function to check for required dependencies and prompts the user to install any missing packages before execution.

6. Feature Extraction:

First Code (PyTorch): Relies solely on the raw pixel values of the images for training the model.

Second Code (TensorFlow): Incorporates additional features extracted through computer vision techniques (edge detection and Hough transform) to enhance the model's input representation.

In summary, while both codes aim to predict crack propagation paths, they differ in their choice of deep learning frameworks, model architectures, data preprocessing methods, training processes, dependency management, and feature extraction techniques.
